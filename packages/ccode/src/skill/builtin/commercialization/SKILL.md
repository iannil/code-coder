## Pricing Strategies

### Pricing Models

### Pricing Framework

**Cost-Plus Pricing:**
```
Price = Cost × (1 + Margin)
```

**Value-Based Pricing:**
```
Price = Value to Customer × Capture Rate

Example:
- Tool saves 10 hours/month
- User's time worth $50/hour
- Value = $500/month
- Capture 20% = $100/month price
```

**Competitive Pricing:**
```
Position relative to competitors:
- Premium: +20-50%
- Parity: ±10%
- Economy: -20-50%
```

### Tier Design

```

   100%          15%           40%           20%           80%

   ↓             ↓             ↓             ↓             ↓
Landing      Signup        Onboarding    Upgrade       Engagement
Optimization Flow          Improvement   Prompt        Features
```

### Revenue Levers

1. **Volume** - More users
2. **Conversion** - More paying users
3. **ARPU** - Higher price per user
4. **Retention** - Longer customer lifetime
5. **Expansion** - More revenue per customer

### Churn Reduction

**Voluntary Churn:**
- Exit surveys to understand reasons
- Improve product value
- Better onboarding

**Involuntary Churn:**

- Payment method updates
- Dunning emails

## Metrics Framework

### Key Revenue Metrics

| Metric | Formula | Target |
|--------|---------|--------|
| MRR | Monthly recurring revenue | Growing |
| ARR | MRR × 12 | Growing |
| ARPU | MRR / Customers | Increasing |
| LTV | ARPU × Avg lifetime | > 3× CAC |
| CAC | Acquisition spend / New customers | Decreasing |
| Payback | CAC / Monthly margin | < 12 months |

### Health Indicators
