**Indirect Competitors**
Products solving the same problem differently, or different problems for the same audience.

**Potential Competitors**
Adjacent products that could enter your space.

| Category | Data Points |
|----------|-------------|
| Product | Features, pricing, platforms, integrations |
| Users | Target audience, user reviews, community size |
| Business | Funding, team size, revenue model, growth rate |
| Technical | Stack, performance, reliability, open source? |
| Marketing | Positioning, messaging, channels, content |

## Feature Comparison

### Comparison Template

| Feature | Us | Competitor A | Competitor B |
|---------|-----|--------------|--------------|

| Core Feature 2 | ⚠️ Beta | ✅ Full | ❌ None |
| Integration X | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Pricing | $X/mo | $Y/mo | Free |

### Feature Depth Analysis

Don't just check if a feature exists—evaluate quality:

```
Feature: User Authentication

Us: OAuth2, SSO, MFA, passwordless
Competitor A: OAuth2 only
Competitor B: Email/password only

Depth Score: 9/10 vs 5/10 vs 3/10
```

## Positioning Analysis

### Messaging Analysis

Extract competitor positioning from:

- Homepage headlines
- Product descriptions
- Taglines and slogans
- Customer testimonials (who they feature)

### Positioning Map

Plot competitors on key dimensions:

```

```

### Differentiation Opportunities

Identify positioning gaps:

1. Underserved segments
2. Unaddressed pain points
