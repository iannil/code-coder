# Entry Point Strategy

Framework for identifying and executing market entry approaches.

## Entry Point Types

### 1. Wedge Strategy

Enter with a focused solution, then expand.

```
Phase 1: Nail one use case
    ↓
Phase 2: Expand to adjacent uses
    ↓
Phase 3: Platform play

Example:
Slack: Internal team chat → Enterprise comms → Work platform
```

**Wedge Criteria:**
- Small enough to dominate quickly
- Large enough to matter
- Natural expansion path
- Defensible position

### 2. Trojan Horse

Free/low-cost entry that leads to larger opportunity.

```
Free Tool → Data/Insights → Paid Product

Example:
- Free website grader → Marketing automation platform
- Free code hosting → Enterprise DevOps
```

### 3. Consumerization

Bring consumer experience to business context.

```
Consumer Delight → Business Productivity

Example:
- Dropbox: Simple file sync for everyone
- Notion: Beautiful docs for teams
```

### 4. Unbundling

Break off a piece of an integrated solution.

```
Bloated Suite → Focused Tool

Example:
- Extract analytics from ERP
- Pull reporting from CRM
```

### 5. Rebundling

Combine fragmented tools into one.

```
Tool A + Tool B + Tool C → Unified Solution

Example:
- All-in-one marketing platform
- Complete developer toolkit
```
