Writes a file to the local filesystem.

Usage:
- This tool will overwrite the existing file if there is one at the provided path.
- If this is an existing file, you MUST use the Read tool first to read the file's contents. This tool will fail if you did not read the file first.
- ALWAYS prefer editing existing files in the codebase. NEVER write new files unless explicitly required.
- NEVER proactively create documentation files (*.md) or README files. Only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the User.
- Only use emojis if the user explicitly requests it. Avoid writing emojis to files unless asked.

Large File Handling:
- For large files (>500 lines or >20KB), use a two-step approach:
  1. Write the file structure and initial content using Write tool
  2. Use Edit tool for subsequent large additions
- Alternative: Use Bash tool with echo/heredoc to write very large content, then verify with Read
- This prevents JSON parameter size limits from causing "Unterminated string" errors
